# Snake game
Players control a long, thin creature, resembling a snake to roam around on a bordered plan, picking up food/coins.
The more food/coins it collects, the longer the snake becomes. 
The game ends when the snake hits either its own body or the edges of the playing area.
The goal of the game is to collect as much food/coins as possible before hitting its own body or the edges of the playing area.
There will be an inventory function and shop function, where users will be able to use the food/coins they collect throughout games to buy new skins.

# Snake game
Players control a long, thin creature, resembling a snake to roam around on a bordered plan, picking up food/coins.
The more food/coins it collects, the longer the snake becomes. 
The game ends when the snake hits either its own body or the edges of the playing area.
The goal of the game is to collect as much food/coins as possible before hitting its own body or the edges of the playing area.
There will be an inventory function and shop function, where users will be able to use the food/coins they collect throughout games to buy new skins.

# Testing
After you die in the game, sometimes it takes long to load back to the Menu.
Leaderboard takes quite long to load sometimes.
While testing out the game in its initial stages, when the "snake" crashes, into the wall, it would continuously generate and go out of the borders even though it should have been game over.
Another problem that occured early on was that when the "snake" was supposed to eat the food, it just went over it.
